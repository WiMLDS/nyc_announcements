## ENIGMA FEATURED DATASET 
On behalf of the [Between Two Rows](https://us5.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=04aa10cf99e0998bd8e69a109&id=e53dcad000) newsletter from [Enigma](https://www.enigma.com):  

Transparency International ranks countries annually according to their perceived level of corruption. They use data sources ranging from the Economist Intelligence Unit, and the World Bank - and the results would be quite interesting to combine with signal from social or media mentions. Check out the [source](https://www.transparency.org) and the [data](https://public.enigma.com/datasets/transparency-international-corruption-perceptions-index-2016/91e2b23f-a37d-42c0-be3e-73b5e1ae49e6).
